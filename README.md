# Gnome Pipeline WIP

## THIS PROJECT IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSE ONLY

I wanted to make this project to learn more about the USD Workflow, that's why the UI is based on Prism USD (A really great tool for usd workflow).

## GNOME APP

This app lets you create assets folders and structure your project with departments.
